# Resources related to governance in Cardano

This project was developed for the Cardano Tech Week hackathon with a focus on Governance. The project, called dExpo (Decentralized Exposition), aims to address the lack of transparency in the selection and election of committee members. It provides a platform for displaying relevant data about committee members and their actions, allowing users to track exactly how each member votes and abstains. The goal is to foster transparency and gather feedback on the committeesâ€™ perceptions, with the ability to run for committee membership, propose actions, and receive votes.
